Key Features:
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests books based on user ratings and the preferences of similar users.

Clustering-Based Approach: Employs the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to group similar users and books, enhancing recommendation accuracy.

Interactive Web Application: Built with Streamlit, the project features a user-friendly interface for browsing, rating, and receiving recommendations.

User Management: Includes a login and registration system for a personalized experience.

Data-Driven: The model is trained on the Book-Crossing dataset, a large collection of user ratings, and book information.

Technologies Used:
Python

scikit-learn (for the NearestNeighbors model)

Streamlit (for the web application)

pandas and numpy (for data handling and analysis)
